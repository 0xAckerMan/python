```python
# Declare a first name variable and assign a value to it
first_name = 'John'

# Declare a last name variable and assign a value to it
last_name = 'Doe'

# Declare a full name variable and assign a value to it
full_name = 'John Doe'

# Declare a country variable and assign a value to it
country = "Germany"

# Declare a city variable and assign a value to it
city = "Denmark"

# Declare an age variable and assign a value to it
age = 45

# Declare a year variable and assign a value to it
year = 2030

# Declare a variable is_married and assign a value to it
is_married = True

# Declare a variable is_true and assign a value to it
is_true = False

# Declare a variable is_light_on and assign a value to it
is_light_on = False

# Declare multiple variable on one line
hobby, language = "coding", "Python"
```

## Exercises: Level 2
```python
# Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function

print(type(first_name))
print(type(last_name))
print(type(full_name))
print(type(age))
print(type(is_married))

# Using the len() built-in function, find the length of your first name
print(len(first_name))

#Compare the length of your first name and your last name
print(first_name == last_name)

# Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
num_one = 5
num_two = 4

# i. Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
total = num_one + num_one

# ii. Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
variable_diff = num_two - num_one

# iii. Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
product = num_two * num_one

# iv. Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
division = num_one / num_two

# v. Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
remainder = num_two % num_one

# vi. Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
exp = num_two ** num_one

# vii. Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
floor_division = num_one // num_two



#The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
# i. Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of area_of_circle
PI = 3.142
radius = int(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
area_of_circle = PI*radius**2

# ii. Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of circum_of_circle
circum_of_circle = 2*PI*radius

# iii. Take radius as user input and calculate the area.

print(area_of_circle)


# Run help('keywords') in Python shell or in your file to check for the Python reserved words or keywords
help("keywords")
