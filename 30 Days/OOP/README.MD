- student.py
```
Its just a simple program that takes input of a student details {name && house}.
Starting from here to build on the program as I learn along the concepts of OOP.
```

- 0-student.py
```
Here reduce the two functions (get_name && get_house)into one function (get_student)
And returns 2 values in a tuple
